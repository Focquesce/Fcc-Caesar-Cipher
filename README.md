# Fcc-Caesar-Cipher
For those of you who don't know, Caesar Cipher is basically a modus operandi of encryption (gotta stay latin, Caesar and Modus Operandi are both Latin) where each letter of the roman alphabet in a text is replaced with another letter in the roman alphabet exactly 13 places away from it. Why? because the number of letters in the roman alphabet divided by two gives 13. Simple, but efficient. E.g. Olssv Dvysk! in Caesar Cipher would translate to Hello World! in standard english. Now try to paste this code in your code editor or IDE and try it out!
