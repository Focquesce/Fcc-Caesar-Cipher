# Fcc-Caesar-Cipher
For those of you who don't know, Caesar Cipher is basically a modus operandi of encryption (gotta stay latin, Caesar and Modus Operandi) where each letter of the roman alphabet in a text is replaced with another letter in the roman alphabet x places away from it. Simple, but efficient. E.g. Qnuux Fxaum! in Caesar Cipher with respect to a shift of 9 letters forward would translate to Hello World! in standard english. Now try to paste this code in your code editor or IDE and try it out!
